NUOS_VER=0.0.12.999a0

# NOTE: This executable is often shadowed by lines at the bottom of root's .(c)shrc file(s).
#       Usage of that alias is a straightforward `nuos` to load the system distributed version
#       of nuOS. Using this executable loads its version of nuOS but is used differently. Its
#       output must be sourced a la:
#           eval `bin/nuos`
#       The prompt will include a ♥ while you're running the system console or a ♣ when you're
#       running this development version. The system console can be redirected to a local version
#       by overriding the symbolic link found on your system at "/nuos".
