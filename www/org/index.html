	<h2>Vision</h2>
	
	<p><big>for all humans worldwide, an easy to use, free of cost, state of the art, standards compliant, open sourced, censorship resistant, operating system and decentralized communication infrastructure for personal, public or private socialization, trade, finance, journalism, art, science, research, education and community governance</big></p>
	
	<h2>Mission</h2>
	
	<p><big>transparent collaboration that promotes merit, equity and inclusion to enhance society’s infrastructure, empower individuals, families and communities to prosper free of industry overlords, thriving in a fair and accessible manner while expanding the decentralized open source user base, together continuously improving our system architecture, network engineering, and software development processes</big></p>
	
	<h2>Scope</h2>
		
	<ul class="no-bull">

	<h2>Difference</h2>
	
	<p>Established technology architecture further entrenches a tacit de facto oligopoly of a small number of massive centralized profiteering firms aligned with an even fewer number of public entities who serve humanity inefficiently and ineffectually at best, disingenuously and deceptively at worst. Present innovations only fracture this space, further confounding would-be users with an overwhelming number of choices between incompatible systems, most of which are destined for obscurity. We are pioneering an innovative approach with a novel architecture designed to address the aforementioned shortcomings.</p>

	<p>Rather than exploiting the user as the commodity while encouraging sensational and outrageous content, we assert our approach can manage and monetize user invention, journalism and art with incentives aligned toward fairness, truth, grace and refinement. The cost of operation and access for our user starts at zero without any advertiser subsidy, increasing only marginally and affordably for the power-user while offering greater, more flexible revenue for the content creator.</p>

	<h2>Goals</h2>
	
	<p>Decentralize network and compute infrastructure. Disrupt Big Tech. Overcome Wall Street. Surmount the Federal Reserve. Eschew the international banking cartels. Cultivate faith and spread hope. Encourage world peace. Further prosperity and heighten abundance.</p>
