	<h2>Vision</h2>
	
	<p><big>We shall establish for all humans worldwide, an easy to use, free of cost, state of the art, standards compliant, open sourced, censorship resistant, operating system and decentralized communication infrastructure. We shall evolve this platform for personal, public or private socialization, trade, finance, journalism, art, science, research, education and community self-governance.</big></p>
	
	<h2>Mission</h2>
	
	<p><big>We must collaborate transparently to promote merit, equity and inclusion in our activities. We endeavor to enhance society’s infrastructure, empower individuals, families and communities to prosper free from industry overlords and to thrive in a fair and accessible manner by expanding the user base of decentralized, open source technologies. Together, we shall continuously improve our system architecture, network engineering, and software development processes in ways that protect even the lowliest individual while encouraging sovereign families and strengthening self-organized communities.</big></p>
	
	<h2>Scope</h2>
		
	<ul class="no-bull">
		<li>nuOS.org</li>
		<ul><li>a new operating system that scales and integrates well between massive data centers, personal devices and the so-called internet of things</li></ul>

		<li>nuOS.net</li>
		<ul><li>a community powered optional network infrastructure to lower the barrier of entry to our digital platform</li></ul>

		<li>nu.Gold, nu.Cash, nu.Money</li>
		<ul><li>cryptographic assets, debts, equities and robust smart contract platform for uses in trade by individuals, families, the organization, formation and operation of units or parties and the incorporation of firms and companies</li></ul>

		<li>nu.Chat, nu.Email, nu.Show, nu.Live, nu.LOL</li>
		<ul><li>bundled, extensible, well-integrated applications for communication, media publishing and social feedback</li></ul>

		<li>nu.School</li>
		<ul><li>a creative commons training academy, open library of knowledge, free market for guidance and forum for wisdom—one that never need shy away from controversy for sake of financial or political insecurities but instead shall naturally promote consensual ideologies through compassionate compromise driven by humans’ natural thirst for understanding</li></ul>

		<li>nu.Team, nu.Parts</li>
		<ul><li>logistics, resource management, production, construction and manufacturing</li></ul>

		<li>nu.Software, nu.Click</li>
		<ul><li>software discovery, distribution and curation with an <em>optional</em> advertising brokerage platform</li></ul>
	</ul>

	<h2>Difference</h2>
	
	<p>Established technology architecture further entrenches a tacit de facto oligopoly of a small number of massive centralized profiteering firms aligned with an even fewer number of public entities who serve humanity inefficiently and ineffectually at best, disingenuously and deceptively at worst. Present innovations only fracture this space, further confounding would-be users with an overwhelming number of choices between incompatible systems, most of which are destined for obscurity. We are pioneering an innovative approach with a novel architecture designed to address the aforementioned shortcomings.</p>

	<p>Rather than exploiting the user as the commodity while encouraging sensational and outrageous content, we assert our approach can manage and monetize users’ insight, invention, innovation, journalism and art with an incentive structure aligned toward fairness, truth, grace, refinement, correspondence and cohesion. The cost of operation and access for our user starts at zero without any advertiser subsidy, increasing only marginally and affordably for the power-user while offering greater, more flexible revenue for the content creator.</p>

	<h2>Goals</h2>
	
	<p>Disrupt Big Tech. Overcome Wall Street. Surmount the Federal Reserve. Eschew the international banking cartels. Cultivate faith and spread hope. Further prosperity and heighten abundance. Encourage world peace.</p>

	<p><big>Put a chicken in <em>every</em> pot. Surf and turf for <em>any</em> enterprising independent entrepreneur.</big></p>

	<h2>nuOS Daughter Projects</h2>

	<h3>Same.Name</h3>
	
	<p>Current proprietary tech monopolies are maintained, and fledgling market entrants kept divided, through their necessary ownership of each’s pertinent and fractured aspects of users’ identities and reputations. Namecoin (the first and most well established invention ever to effectively solve the ageless engineering trilemma known as <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooko%27s_triangle">Zooko’s triangle</a>) empowers individuals to have total sovereignty over their identity with no centralized entity of authority nor any single point of failure. Free and open sourced nuOS software builds upon Namecoin to enable private and decentralized individual management of societal concepts such as association, reputation, copyright, trademark, patent and much more, all in a boundless and permissionless global network, remaining backward compatible while exponentially increasing Namecoin’s robustness against <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack">Sybil attack</a>.</p>
	
	<p>The branded service Same.Name is offered to lower the barriers of entry into this innovative network. Using Same.Name, vanilla nuOS or any other compatible software implementation of their choosing, each participant may take individual responsibility for subject/object authorization while the greater global network seamlessly provides subject authentication and object integrity. This allows every user to take back ownership of their identity and reputation while surfing freely between sites and apps without logging in or revealing any sensitive or personally identifiable information whatsoever. This conjunction technologies allows users the flexibility to migrate memberships and distribute data entirely at their own will without losing relationships between subjects or links between objects, all while eliminating would-be permission-granting or limiting authorities. Thus, new entrants to an entirely new landscape of social technologies are empowered to innovate and flourish on stable and even footing, to compete with established behemoths primarily on the basis of service quality and value rather than predominantly by their size and power.</p>
	
	<h3>Candid.Press, Leak.Report</h3>
	
	<p>Any nuGold nugget tagged #press or #leak appears on these sites, lowering the barrier of entry for journalists and news hounds. On the other hand, installing nuOS proper will maximally preserve reporting and editorial agency independence.</p>

	<h3>Yooj.Tube, Right.Tube, Noble.Tube</h3>
	
	<p>Video and interactive nuggets tagged #pol(itical), #right or #left aggregate here. Note: nuGold tags can be offered by anyone but are openly moderated through fair consensus mechanisms without censorship. Furthermore, moderation and reputation by the nuGold subsystem is handled in a user-centric manner rather than with a top-down approach. This means nuOS considers your chosen associations to determine what you’ll find interesting or indecent; filtering is always optional and sorting always selectable, on the fly.</p>

	<h3>CivX.Tech</h3>
	
	<p>While nuOS empowers community governance, association and federation, this site presents a transparent interface with the global network. Nearly every aspect of nuOS is democratically evolving. Equality and equity are protected with our novel approach to identity.</p>
	
	<h3>Freer.Trade, Pawn.Today</h3>
	
	<p>Auction, offer, buy, lend or lease goods, services and capital using nuOS without fees, overhead, middlemen or counter-party risk.</p>
	
	<h3>Brave.Help, Hero.Rent, Mercenary.Pro</h3>
	
	<p>Public and private security, defense and force are held accountable, service is incentivized and transparency enforced or privacy preserved, as prudent.</p>

	<h3>Freshest.Garden, Ecodome.Farm, FeedOur.World</h3>
	
	<p>Agriculture evolved—healthy, sustainable. Technology to end hunger globally is within reach of those taking responsibility to coordinate.</p>
	
	<h3>Pure.Doctor, Together.Rehab, NoLifeguardOnDuty.fyi</h3>
	
	<p>Eliminating conflicts of interest in the market spaces of medical and mental health with community leadership and participation.</p>
	
	<h3>Faith.Agency, Homies.Fund</h3>
	
	<p>Fellowship, spirituality and charity made accessible and inclusive.</p>
	
	<h3>Man.Coach, Dad.University, Lady.Ninja, WifeKnows.Best</h3>
	
	<p>Promotes family values, protects individual freedom, encourages personal growth, community support and civil behavior.</p>

	<blockquote><p><em>These nuOS projects aren’t merely disparate services, rather integrated features that compound together!</em></p></blockquote>
