	<h2>Vision</h2>
	
	<p><big>We shall establish for all humans worldwide, an easy to use, free of cost, state of the art, standards compliant, open sourced, censorship resistant, operating system and decentralized communication infrastructure. We shall evolve this platform for personal, public or private socialization, trade, finance, journalism, art, science, research, education and community self-governance.</big></p>
	
	<h2>Mission</h2>
	
	<p><big>We must collaborate transparently to promote merit, equity and inclusion in our activities. We endeavor to enhance society’s infrastructure, empower individuals, families and communities to prosper free from industry overlords and to thrive in a fair and accessible manner by expanding the user base of decentralized, open source technologies. Together, we shall continuously improve our system architecture, network engineering, and software development processes in ways that protect even the lowliest individual while strengthening self-reliance and sovereignty, family unity, and encouraging communities to self-organize.</big></p>
	
	<h2>Scope</h2>
		
	<ul class="no-bull">
		<li>nuOS.org</li>
		<ul><li>a new (or, <em>“<strong>n</strong>ext <strong>u</strong>nderground”</em>, if you will) operating system that scales and integrates well between personal devices, massive data centers and the so-called internet of things</li></ul>

		<li>nuOS.net</li>
		<ul><li>a community powered optional network infrastructure, made to lower the barrier of entry to our digital platform and to serve as a universal common ground without gates or tolls</li></ul>

		<li>nu.Gold, nu.Cash, nu.Money</li>
		<ul><li>cryptographic assets, debt/credit and equity instruments with a robust smart contract platform for uses in trade by individuals, families and communities, for the organization, formation and operation of parties or agents, the incorporation of firms and companies, allowing the management of all such by every manner of stakeholder, given the benefit of feedback from all concerned, according to fair, open- and free-market economic principles</li></ul>

		<li>nu.Chat, nu.Email, nu.Show, nu.Live, nu.LOL</li>
		<ul><li>bundled, extensible, well-integrated applications for communication, media publishing and social feedback; protecting freedom and promoting courage for individuals to meet and for groups to assemble and interact, cooperatively or competitively, in cyberspace or on Earth—to seek and to be sought, to correspond and/or to dissent—while being seen, heard and evaluated individually, according to each on their merits, each using their own sensibilities and unique social network perspective (as opposed to judgement through some top-down hierarchy, or according to mob association, or by <em>any</em> such administration of unequal powers)</li></ul>

		<li>nu.School</li>
		<ul><li>a creative commons training academy, open library of knowledge, free market for guidance and forum for wisdom—one that never need shy away from controversy for sake of financial or political insecurities but instead shall naturally promote consensual ideologies through compassionate compromise driven by humans’ natural thirst for mutual understanding</li></ul>

		<li>nu.Team, nu.Parts</li>
		<ul><li>logistics, resource management, production, construction and manufacturing</li></ul>

		<li>nu.Software, nu.Click</li>
		<ul><li>software discovery, distribution and curation with an <em>optional</em> advertising brokerage platform</li></ul>
	</ul>

	<h2>Difference</h2>
	
	<p>Established technology architecture further entrenches with each passing day a tacit de facto oligopoly of a small number of massive centralized profiteering firms aligned with an even fewer number of public entities who serve humanity inefficiently and ineffectually at best, disingenuously and deceptively at worst. Current so-called innovations only fracture this space, further confounding would-be users with an overwhelming number of choices between incompatible systems, most of which are ultimately destined for obscurity if not a nearly unbearable market condition. We are pioneering an innovative approach with a novel architecture designed to address the aforementioned plagues and shortcomings.</p>

	<p>Rather than exploiting the user as the commodity while encouraging sensational and outrageous content, we assert our approach can practically manage and effectively monetize users’ insight, invention, innovation, journalism and art with an incentive structure aligned toward fairness, truth, correspondence, empathy and cohesion. The cost of operation and access for our user starts at zero without relying on any advertiser subsidy, increasing only marginally and affordably for the power-user while offering greater, more flexible revenue streams for content creators and curators.</p>

	<h2>Goals</h2>
	
	<p>Disrupt Big Tech. Overcome Wall Street. Supplant the Federal Reserve. Supercede the international banking cartels. Cultivate faith and spread hope. Further prosperity and heighten abundance. Encourage sustainable world peace through mutual respect, accessible technology and robust trade relations rather than through dominant authority and brittle stalemate.</p>

	<p><big>Put a chicken in <em>every</em> pot. Surf and turf for <em>any</em> enterprising independent entrepreneur.</big></p>

	<h2>Licence</h2>
	
	<h3>BSD/MIT</h3>
	
	<p>All work for this society shall be released with included source code and all of the allowances granted under the BSD and MIT licenses.</p>
	
	<p>The Berkeley Standard Distribution Licence and Massachusetts Institute of Technology License are among the most concise and permissive licensing agreements widely recognized by governments and the industries of technology and software development, drafted to maximally preserve the rights of users along with the liberties of engineers and developers. Contrast these to so-called “copyleft” licenses such as GNU/GPL (Gnu’s Not Unix, Gnu Public License) which attempt to enforce a socialist contract among their developers and users that, while certainly well-intending, trends toward monopolicy, oligopoly and nexuses of power naturally arising out of that misguided (if nonetheless noble) ideology while simultaneously hamstringing their users’ and adopters’ means of escape from beneath the “umbrella”.</p>
	
	<h2>nuOS Daughter Projects</h2>

	<h3>Same.Name</h3>
	
	<p>Current proprietary tech monopolies are maintained, and fledgling market entrants kept divided, through their necessary ownership of each’s pertinent and fractured aspects of users’ identities and reputations. Namecoin (the first and most well established invention ever to effectively solve the ageless engineering trilemma known as <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooko%27s_triangle">Zooko’s triangle</a>) empowers individuals to have total sovereignty over their identity with no centralized entity of authority nor any single point of failure. Free and open sourced nuOS software builds upon Namecoin to enable private and decentralized individual management of societal concepts such as association, reputation, copyright, trademark, patent and much more, all in a boundless and permissionless global network, remaining backward compatible while exponentially increasing Namecoin’s robustness against <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack">Sybil attack</a>.</p>
	
	<p>The branded service Same.Name is offered to lower the barriers of entry into this innovative network. Using Same.Name, vanilla nuOS or any other compatible software implementation of their choosing, each participant may take individual responsibility for subject/object authorization while the greater global network seamlessly provides subject authentication and object integrity. This allows every user to take back ownership of their identity and reputation while surfing freely between sites and apps without logging in or revealing any sensitive or personally identifiable information whatsoever. This conjunction technologies allows users the flexibility to migrate memberships and distribute data entirely at their own will without losing relationships between subjects or links between objects, all while eliminating would-be permission-granting or limiting authorities. Thus, new entrants to an entirely new landscape of social technologies are empowered to innovate and flourish on stable and even footing, to compete with established behemoths primarily on the basis of service quality and value rather than predominantly by their size and power.</p>
	
	<h3>Candid.Press, Leak.Report</h3>
	
	<p>Any nuGold nugget tagged #press or #leak appears on these sites, lowering the barrier of entry for journalists and news hounds. On the other hand, installing nuOS proper will maximally preserve reporting integrity and editorial agency, autonomy, sovereignty and independence. Furthermore, nuOS proper offers the consumer verifiable transparency into the entire editorial, attribution and distribution network.</p>

	<h3>Yooj.Tube, Right.Tube, Noble.Tube</h3>
	
	<p>Video and interactive nuggets tagged #pol(itical), #right or #left aggregate here. Note: nuGold tags can be offered by anyone but are openly moderated through fair consensus mechanisms without censorship. Furthermore, moderation and reputation by the nuGold subsystem is handled in a user-centric manner rather than with a top-down approach. This means nuOS considers your chosen associations to determine what you’ll find interesting or indecent; filtering is always optional and sorting always selectable, on the fly.</p>

	<h3>CivX.Tech</h3>
	
	<p>While nuOS empowers community governance, association and federation, this site presents a transparent interface with the global network. Nearly every aspect of nuOS is democratically evolving. Equality and equity are protected with our novel approach to identity.</p>
	
	<h3>Libre.Trade, Pawn.Today</h3>
	
	<p>Auction, offer, buy, lend or lease goods, services and capital using nuOS without fees, overhead, middlemen or counter-party risk.</p>
	
	<h3>Brave.Help, Hero.Rent, Mercenary.Pro</h3>
	
	<p>Public and private security, defense and force are held accountable, service is incentivized and transparency enforced or privacy preserved, as prudent.</p>

	<h3>Freshest.Garden, Ecodome.Farm, FeedOur.World</h3>
	
	<p>Agriculture evolved—healthy, sustainable. Technology to end hunger globally is within reach of those taking responsibility to coordinate.</p>
	
	<h3>Pure.Doctor, Together.Rehab, NoLifeguardOnDuty.fyi</h3>
	
	<p>Eliminating conflicts of interest with community leadership and participation in the market spaces of medical and mental health.</p>
	
	<h3>Faith.Agency, Homies.Fund</h3>
	
	<p>Fellowship, spirituality and charity made accessible and inclusive.</p>
	
	<h3>Man.Coach, Dad.University, Lady.Ninja, WifeKnows.Best</h3>
	
	<p>Promotes family values, protects individual freedom, encourages personal growth, community support and civil behavior.</p>

	<blockquote><p><em>These nuOS projects aren’t merely disparate services; they integrate through the innovative nuOS platform to operate in familiar and consistent ways. Furthermore, you may integrate their features into your own third-party applications and services confidently knowing they will necessarily remain decentralized, free and privacy preserving.</em></p></blockquote>
